# Unicycle-Race
GUI created using the swing that displays a group of unicycles that move with different speeds according to a slider
# What I learned
  - Use swing API to create animations
  - Apply Composite Pattern so that groups of unicycles are treated the same way as a single unicycle, creating intricate behaviors
  with little code changes
